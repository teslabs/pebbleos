/**
 * @defgroup task_wdt Task watchdog
 * @ingroup subsys
 * @brief Software watchdog that catches stuck threads and turns them into core dumps.
 *
 * Each channel watches one thread that has to keep proving it makes progress by feeding the
 * channel within its timeout, unless it is waiting for work (see pbl_task_wdt_set_waiting()). A
 * thread at the highest priority checks the channels every @c CONFIG_TASK_WDT_CHECK_PERIOD_MS and
 * feeds the hardware watchdog. A channel that expires is
 * logged and recorded in the reboot reason, and its callback gets a chance to recover the
 * thread; once it stays expired for @c CONFIG_TASK_WDT_GRACE_MS after the check that found it
 * expired, the system resets with a core dump (with @c CONFIG_WATCHDOG; otherwise it only
 * logs). The pool holds @c CONFIG_TASK_WDT_CHANNELS channels.
 *
 * @code{.c}
 * static void prv_worker(void *arg) {
 *   int ch = pbl_task_wdt_add(NULL, CONFIG_TASK_WDT_TIMEOUT_MS, NULL, NULL);
