//! @file
//! This file manages what's currently shown on the screen of your Pebble!
//! There are two main things that are managed by the compositor...
//!
//! <h3>The App Framebuffer</h3>
//! This is the framebuffer the app is currently drawing into. The compositor
//! handles animating between app framebuffers when the app changes and window
//! animations requested by the window stack. The compositor will also draw in
//! the status bar when the app is in fullscreen, and the app will adjust its
//! framebuffer's destination frame vertically. The framebuffer is simply
//! bitblt'ed into the appropriate position whenever the compositor flushes
//! to the display.
//!
//! @see \ref compositor_transition
//! @see \ref compositor_render_app
//! @see \ref compositor_app_render_ready
//!
//! <h3>Modal Window</h3>
//! A modal window is a Window that can be rendered on top of an app without
//! interrupting it. The modal window can only be supplied by the kernel, so
//! we can trust its contents. The modal window is animated up and down the
//! screen when its pushed and popped. Since the window doesn't have a framebuffer
//! of its own, we render it to the main framebuffer on top of everything else
//! whenever the compositor flushes to the display.
//!
//! @see \ref compositor_render_modal
//! @see \ref compositor_modal_render_ready
//!

//! Transition direction, from the current position to the next.
//! For example, Up is a transition to some item that is upwards of the current screen.

//! the new animation will need to call this in order to properly render.
//! A good use-case for this is when the transition needs to use an animation_sequence.
