//! Strong override of the PBL_WEAK fake_events.c implementation, for tests that
//! exercise the GATT client service-change event (which carries a heap-allocated
//! info pointer that must be freed).
//!
//! The default implementation reads the discriminant from gatt_client.subtype,
//! matching the firmware. That works on-target, but on a 64-bit unit-test host
//! uintptr_t is wider than on-target, so the overlapping gatt_client and
//! gatt_client_service union members place their subtype fields at different
//! offsets and neither member alone reliably identifies the variant. The only
//! robust signal on the host is the info pointer itself: a real service-change
//! event holds a live tracked allocation there, whereas the other gatt_client
//! variants leave that slot NULL or filled with non-pointer data. Free it only
//! when it is a tracked allocation.
//!
//! Include this header in the test's main translation unit (the one that pulls
//! in fake_pbl_malloc.h) so the override sees the same allocation tracking list.
