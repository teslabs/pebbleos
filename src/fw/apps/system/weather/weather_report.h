// On rect (emery/obelix): a static newspaper front page for today — masthead, dateline,
// weekday headline, condition deck, framed press-photo icon, temperature column and a
// boxed UV-index tally on cream newsprint. (7-day paging comes later.)
// On round (gabbro/getafix): the classic condensed layout host (weather_app_layout),
// hold UP/DOWN to scroll days — unchanged.
// `days` is BORROWED (not copied) — the caller (weather.c) owns it for the app's lifetime.
//! Clear the launch-persistent statics; call once from the app's init (a crashed
//! run never reaches unload, so the next launch would read stale pointers).
