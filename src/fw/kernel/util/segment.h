//! Memory Segments
//!
//! A memory segment is a representation of a contiguous chunk of memory.
//! Memory segments can be split, dividing the segment in two. This API
//! is designed to simplify tasks such as process loading where a chunk
//! of memory must be allocated into a bunch of smaller chunks of
//! various fixed and dynamic sizes.

typedef struct MemorySegment {
  void *start; //!< The lowest address of the segment
  void *end;   //!< One past the highest address of the segment
} MemorySegment;

//! Returns the size of the largest object that the segment can contain.
size_t memory_segment_get_size(MemorySegment *segment);

//! Align the start pointer of a segment such that it is suitably
//! aligned for any object.
void memory_segment_align(MemorySegment *segment);

//! Split a memory segment into two.
//!
//! The child memory segment is allocated from the start of the parent,
//! and the start of the parent is moved to the end of the child.
//!
//! After the split, the start addresses of both the parent and the
//! child are guaranteed to be suitably aligned for any object.
//!
//! @param parent the memory segment to split.
//! @param child the memory segment created from the split. May be NULL.
//! @param size size of the new memory segment.
//!
//! @return start of child memory segment if successful, or NULL if
//!         there is not enough space in the parent segment to split
//!         with the requested size.
