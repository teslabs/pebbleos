//! Minimal bidirectional text engine, a subset of Unicode UAX 9.
//!
//! Implements the rules that matter for a single line of watch text:
//! P2/P3 (paragraph direction), W1 (marks follow their base), W2 and W4-W7
//! (numbers take their class from the letter before them and absorb their
//! separators and terminators), N1/N2 (neutrals take the surrounding direction,
//! otherwise the paragraph direction), I1/I2 (embedding levels 0-2) and L4
//! (mirrored glyphs). The caller reorders runs by level (L2). Bracket pairs
//! (N0), explicit directional controls, isolates and levels above two are not
//! implemented.

//! Check whether a UTF-8 range needs bidirectional processing at all.
//! Scans raw bytes over every block the class table calls strong right-to-left,
//! so pure-ASCII text costs one comparison per byte and stays on the LTR path.
//! @param start Pointer to start of UTF-8 string
//! @param end Pointer to end of UTF-8 string (exclusive)
//! @return true if the range contains at least one right-to-left character

//! Resolve the paragraph direction of a UTF-8 range (UAX 9 P2/P3).
//! The first strong character wins; ranges without one are left-to-right.
//! @param start Pointer to start of UTF-8 string

//! @return true if the paragraph reads right-to-left
bool bidi_paragraph_is_rtl(const utf8_t *start, const utf8_t *end);

//! Find the extent of the directional run starting at @p pos.
//!
//! Weak types are folded into the neighbouring number and neutrals are
//! resolved against the surrounding runs, so the returned range is a maximal
//! stretch at one embedding level. Levels follow UAX 9 I1/I2 and stay within
//! 0-2: even levels read left-to-right, odd levels right-to-left.
//!
//! @param line_start Start of the line, used to look behind @p pos
//! @param pos Position to start the run at, must be within the line
//! @param end End of the line (exclusive)
//! @param para_is_rtl Paragraph direction, from \ref bidi_paragraph_is_rtl
//! @param[out] run_level Embedding level of the returned run
//! @return Pointer to the first codepoint after the run, or @p pos on failure
