//! \brief Controlling the vibration motor
//!
//! The Vibes API provides calls that let you control Pebble’s vibration motor.
//!
//! The vibration motor can be used as a visceral mechanism for giving immediate feedback to the
//! user. You can use it to highlight important moments in games, or to draw the attention of the
//! user. However, you should use the vibration feature sparingly, because sustained use will
//! rapidly deplete Pebble’s battery, and vibrating Pebble too much and too often can become
//! annoying for users.
//! @note When using these calls, if there is an ongoing vibration,
//! calling any of the functions to emit (another) vibration will have no effect.

/** Data structure describing a vibration pattern.
 A pattern consists of at least 1 vibe-on duration, optionally followed by
 alternating vibe-off + vibe-on durations. Each segment may have a different duration.

 Example code:
 \code{.c}
 // Vibe pattern: ON for 200ms, OFF for 100ms, ON for 400ms:
static const uint32_t segments[] = { 200, 100, 400 };
VibePattern pat = {
  .durations = segments,
  .num_segments = ARRAY_LENGTH(segments),
};
vibes_enqueue_custom_pattern(pat);
\endcode
 @see vibes_enqueue_custom_pattern

/** Data structure describing a vibration pattern with per-segment amplitude control.
 Each segment has a duration and an amplitude. Amplitude 0 means no vibration
 (off), and 100 means maximum strength. Values above 100 are clamped.

 // Ramp-down pattern: 100% for 200ms, 50% for 200ms, 25% for 200ms:
