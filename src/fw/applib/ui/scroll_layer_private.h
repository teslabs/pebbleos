//! tested directly without driving the full recognizer stack. A ScrollLayer is a pure scroll
//! container (no selection model), so a vertical pan drags the content 1:1 and a horizontal swipe
//! navigates (right = BACK, left = SELECT), mirroring MenuLayer's Tier-1 wiring. See scroll_layer.c
//! for the wiring into the per-task recognizer set.

//! Live scroll during a pan (and the final settle on liftoff): move the content to
//! \a base + \a delta_since_start on the y axis, clamped to [min(frame_h - content_h, 0), 0].

//! drivers. Idempotent: a layer that is not registered is a safe no-op.
