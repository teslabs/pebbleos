//! \brief Controlling Pebble's backlight
//!
//! The Light API provides you with functions to turn on Pebble’s backlight or
//! put it back into automatic control. You can trigger the backlight and schedule a timer
//! to automatically disable the backlight after a short delay, which is the preferred
//! method of interacting with the backlight.
//!   @{

//! @return true if the backlight is currently on in any form (on, timed,
//! or fading out). Returns false only when the backlight is fully off.
//! Useful for apps that want to behave differently depending on whether
//! the screen is currently lit — e.g. skipping an animation or queuing a
//! visual cue for when the screen wakes.
bool app_light_is_on(void);

//! Trigger the backlight and schedule a timer to automatically disable the backlight
//! after a short delay. This is the preferred method of interacting with the backlight.
void app_light_enable_interaction(void);

//! Turn the watch's backlight on or put it back into automatic control.
//! Developers should take care when calling this function, keeping Pebble's backlight on for long
//! periods of time will rapidly deplete the battery.
//! @param enable Turn the backlight on if `true`, otherwise `false` to put it back into automatic
//! control.
void app_light_enable(bool enable);

//! Tint the backlight LED to the given color. The color persists while the
//! app is foregrounded and is automatically reset to the user's default
//! (white) when the app exits or is preempted by a system notification.
//! On platforms without a color backlight this is a no-op.
//! @note GColor carries only 2 bits per channel (64 distinct tints). Use
//! light_set_color_rgb888() if you need the full 8-bit-per-channel range
//! that the LED hardware supports.
//! @param color The color to tint the backlight to.
void app_light_set_color(GColor color);

//! Tint the backlight LED to a packed 24-bit RGB value (0x00RRGGBB).
//! Same persistence semantics as light_set_color(): the override lasts
//! while the app is foregrounded and is reset on app exit or system preempt.
//! No-op on platforms without a color backlight.
//! @param rgb Packed 0x00RRGGBB value; 8 bits per channel. High byte ignored.

//! Restore the backlight to the user's default color. Rarely needed — the
//! system resets automatically on app exit. No-op on platforms without a
